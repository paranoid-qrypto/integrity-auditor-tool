A 100% client-side, single-file HTML tool for securely auditing code and verifying file integrity. This tool provides side-by-side code comparison and a comprehensive file hash calculator/verifier (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512).

## Security-First Philosophy

This tool was built with a "paranoid" mindset, prioritizing security and transparency above all else.

*   **100% Client-Side:** All operations happen directly in your web browser. No files, code, or data are ever sent to any server. Your data remains on your machine, always.
*   **Works Completely Offline:** The tool is designed to be fully functional without an internet connection. You can download it and run it on a completely air-gapped computer for maximum security.
*   **Fully Auditable:** The entire source code is contained within a single, human-readable file. There are no hidden packages or compiled code. What you see is what you get.

## Understanding the Project Structure

This repository contains two primary HTML files to serve different use cases:

1.  **`index.html` (for GitHub Pages & Online Use)**
    *   This file is a **completely self-contained application**. All necessary JavaScript (like the `md5.js` library) is embedded directly within the file.
    *   **Purpose:** This ensures that the tool can be hosted on GitHub Pages and run as a true single-file application. It's the file you use when accessing the tool via the web URL.

2.  **`integrity-auditor-tool.html` (for Local Use & Development)**
    *   This file is structured for easier development. It links to external JavaScript files located in the `/js/` directory (e.g., `<script src="js/md5.js"></script>`).
    *   **Purpose:** This is the recommended file to use when you have downloaded the entire repository to your local machine. It keeps the code cleaner and easier to manage.

## How to Use

There are two ways to use the Integrity Auditor Tool:

### 1. Online (Recommended for Quick Access)

Simply visit the live version hosted on GitHub Pages. No download is required.

**[https://paranoid-qrypto.github.io/integrity-auditor-tool/](https://paranoid-qrypto.github.io/integrity-auditor-tool/)**

### 2. Offline (Recommended for Maximum Security)

1.  Download the repository to your local machine (either via `git clone` or by downloading the ZIP file).
2.  Disconnect from the internet (optional, for a true air-gapped environment).
3.  Open the **`integrity-auditor-tool.html`** file in your web browser.

## Key Features

### Code Comparison Tool
*   **Side-by-Side Input:** Paste text or upload files into two panels for direct comparison.
*   **Multi-Level Analysis:**
    *   **Strict Comparison:** Verifies if the content is bit-for-bit identical using SHA-256 hashes.
    *   **Normalized Comparison:** Checks for identity after standardizing line endings and trimming whitespace.
    *   **Whitespace-Removed Comparison:** Checks for identity after removing all whitespace characters.
*   **Stringified View:** Inspect the whitespace-removed versions of your inputs to manually spot differences.

### File Hash Verifier Tool
*   **Comprehensive Hash Calculation:** Calculate **MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-512** hashes for one or more files simultaneously.
*   **Flexible Verification:**
    *   Verify a single file by pasting its expected hash(es).
    *   Verify multiple files at once by pasting a checksum file's content (e.g., `sha256sums.txt`).
*   **Clear Results:** Get an easy-to-read summary of which files passed or failed verification.
*   **Saveable Reports:** Export the calculation or verification results to a timestamped `.txt` file for your records.

## Dependencies & Verification

This tool relies on two primary JavaScript sources for its functionality.

### 1. Web Crypto API (Native Browser API)
*   **Purpose:** Used for all secure hash calculations (**SHA-256, SHA-512**).
*   **Source:** This is a standard, built-in browser API. No third-party code is downloaded.
*   **Note:** This API is only available in secure contexts (HTTPS or localhost).

### 2. js-md5
*   **Version:** `0.7.3`
*   **Purpose:** A lightweight library for calculating **MD5** hashes, included for compatibility with older checksums.
*   **Source of Truth (NPM):** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-md5/v/0.7.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-md5/v/0.7.3)
*   **Direct Download Link:** [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-md5@0.7.3/src/md5.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-md5@0.7.3/src/md5.js)
*   **SHA-256 Hash of `js/md5.js`:** `c690299cd533422a8773ed03a83a6c92404d950e460481dbbc512ba451bbb857`
*   **Note:** The code in `js/md5.js` and the code embedded in `index.html` should both match this hash.
